## Packages
date-fns | Formatting ISO dates and relative times in the dashboard
clsx | Utility for constructing className strings conditionally
tailwind-merge | Utility for merging Tailwind classes safely

## Notes
API returns enveloped responses { ok, data, meta }. Hooks need to unwrap this structure.
The UI is primarily read-only visualization (Dashboard, Runner Detail, Order Detail).
Tailwind config needs to support 'font-display' and 'font-mono' customizations.
